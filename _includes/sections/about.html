        I'm a designer (musician, nutritionist) and photographer based in
        Ottawa, Canada. I specialize in obsessing over fine details while calmly
        translating information into pleasing visual experiences! Specifically,
        my areas of focus are <span class="specialty">branding</span>,
        <span class="specialty">web</span> and
        <span class="specialty">UI/UX</span> design.
      </p>
      <p class="milli hello-text push">
        Learning and creating is where I feel best, so I appreciate that design
        provides infinite opportunities to do both. I am inspired by how each
        mind processes information differently and love to take a collaborative
        approach to design through empathy, research and visual translation.
      </p>
      <p class="milli hello-text push-2">
        Apart from design, I love reading, continuous learning, spending time in
        nature and making music with
