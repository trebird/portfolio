        Ottawa, Canada. I specialize in obsessing over fine details while calmly
        translating information into pleasing, intuitive experiences!

        Learning and creating are where I thrive most, so I love that
        design allows me to live in the best of both worlds while providing
        the opportunity to explore infinite others. I'm also consistently

        visual translation.</p>
